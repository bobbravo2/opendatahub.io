Currently, only <code>CSV</code> is supported.</li>\n<li><code>spec.metrics.schedule</code>: The interval at which the metrics are calculated (optional, defaults to 5 seconds). The duration is specified using the ISO-8601 format, <em>e.g.</em> <code>5s</code> for 5 seconds, <code>5m</code> for 5 minutes, <code>5h</code> for 5 hours, <em>etc</em>.</li>\n<li><code>spec.metrics.batchSize</code>: The observation's historical window size to be used for metrics calculation. This is optional and the default is 5000 (<em>i.e.</em> metrics will be calculated using the latest 5000 inferences)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Workflow</h2>\n<p>The TrustyAI Operator will be installed alongside your other ODH components in your ODH namespace.\nAfter creating a data science project, deploy the TrustyAI CR into that project to create a TrustyAI service, and the operator will link all current/future models in that namespace to that TrustyAI service instance.\nThe recommended workflow is to have a single TrustyAI service per project, with the operator managing all TrustyAI services across any number of projects.</p>\n<h2>Getting Involved and Additional Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Try it out : Try out the new operator installation by enabling it on ODH <code>KfDef</code> and deploying the TrustyAI service.</li>\n<li>Contribution Guide: If you're interested in contributing to the development of the operator (or TrustyAI in general), please review the <a href=\"https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-explainability/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md\">Contribution Guide</a>.
