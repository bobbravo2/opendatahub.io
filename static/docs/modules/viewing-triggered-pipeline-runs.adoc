= Viewing triggered pipeline runs

[role='_abstract']
You can view a list of pipeline runs that were previously executed in {productname-short}. From this list, you can view details relating to your pipeline's runs, such as the pipeline that the run belongs to, along with the run's status, duration, and execution start time.

.Prerequisites

* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* You have installed the OpenShift Pipelines operator.
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `rhods-users` or `rhods-admin` ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]

* You have installed the Data Science Pipelines operator.
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `odh-users` or `odh-admins`) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active and available pipeline server.
* You have previously triggered a pipeline run.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines* -> *Runs*.
+
The *Runs* page opens.
. From the *Project* list, select the project whose previously executed pipeline runs you want to view.
+
The *Run details* page opens.
. Click the *Triggered* tab.
