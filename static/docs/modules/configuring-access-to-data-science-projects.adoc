= Configuring access to data science projects

[role='_abstract']
To enable you to work collaboratively on your data science projects with other users, you can share access to your project. After creating your project, you can then set the appropriate access permissions from the {productname-short} user interface.

You can assign the following access permission levels to your data science projects:

** Admin - Users can modify all areas of a project, including its details (project name and description), components, and access permissions.
** Edit - Users can modify a project's components, such as its workbench, but they cannot edit a project's access permissions or its details (project name and description).
