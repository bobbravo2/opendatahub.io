= Cloning a scheduled pipeline run

[role='_abstract']
To make it easier to schedule runs to execute as part of your pipeline configuration, you can duplicate existing scheduled runs by cloning them.

.Prerequisites
* You have installed the OpenShift Pipelines operator.
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `rhods-users` or `rhods-admin` ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `odh-users` or `odh-admins`) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a configured pipeline server.
* You have imported a pipeline to an active pipeline server.
* You have previously scheduled a run that is available to clone.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines* -> *Runs*.
+
The *Runs* page opens.
. Click the action menu (*&#8942;*) beside the relevant run and click *Clone*.
+
The *Clone* page opens.
. From the *Project* list, select the project that contains the pipeline whose run that you want to clone.
. In the *Name* field, enter a name for the run that you want to clone.
. In the *Description* field, enter a description for the run that you want to clone.
. From the *Pipeline* list, select the pipeline containing the run that you want to clone.
. To configure the run type for the run that you are cloning, in the *Run type* section, perform one of the following sets of actions:
* Select *Run once immediately after create* to specify the run that you are cloning executes once, and immediately after its creation. If you selected this option, skip to step 10.
* Select *Schedule recurring run* to schedule the run that you are cloning to recur.
. If you selected *Schedule recurring run* in the previous step, configure the trigger type for the run, perform one of the following actions:
* Select *Periodic* and select the execution frequency from the *Run every* list.
* Select *Cron* to specify the execution schedule in `cron` format. This creates a cron job to execute the run. Click the *Copy* button (image:images/osd-copy.png[]) to copy the cron job schedule to the clipboard. The field furthest to the left represents seconds. For more information about scheduling tasks using the supported `cron` format, see link:https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format[Cron Expression Format].
. If you selected *Schedule recurring run* in step 7, configure the duration for the run that you are cloning.
.. Select the *Start date* check box to specify a start date for the run. Select the start date using the calendar tool and the start time from the list of times.
.. Select the *End date* check box to specify an end date for the run. Select the end date using the calendar tool and the end time from the list of times.
. In the *Parameters* section, configure the input parameters for the run that you are cloning by selecting the appropriate parameters from the list.
. Click *Create*.

.Verification
* The pipeline run that you cloned is shown in the *Scheduled* tab on the *Runs* page.
