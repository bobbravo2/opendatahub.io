= Deleting a pipeline server

[role='_abstract']
After you have finished running your data science pipelines, you can delete the pipeline server. Deleting a pipeline server automatically deletes all of its associated pipelines and runs. If your pipeline data is stored in a database, the database is also deleted along with its meta-data. In addition, after deleting a pipeline server, you cannot create new pipelines or pipeline runs until you create another pipeline server.

.Prerequisites
* You have logged in to {productname-long}.
ifndef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `rhods-users` or `rhods-admin` ) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
ifdef::upstream[]
* If you are using specialized {productname-short} groups, you are part of the user group or admin group (for example, `odh-users` or `odh-admins`) in OpenShift.
endif::[]
* You have previously created a data science project that is available and contains a pipeline server.

.Procedure
. From the {productname-short} dashboard, click *Data Science Pipelines* -> *Pipelines*.
+
The *Pipelines* page opens.
. From the *Project* list, select the project whose pipeline server you want to delete.
. From the *Pipeline server actions* list, select *Delete pipeline server*.
The *Delete pipeline server* dialog opens.
. Enter the pipeline server's name in the text field to confirm that you intend to delete it.
. Click *Delete*.

.Verification
* Pipelines previously assigned to the deleted pipeline server are no longer displayed on the *Pipelines* page for the relevant data science project.
* Pipeline runs previously assigned to the deleted pipeline server are no longer displayed on the *Runs* page for the relevant data science project.
